# CereSnap - Decentralized Image Classification

CereSnap is a decentralized application that effectively offers users a secure and fast environment for the storage, management, and classification of images. The Cere Network's decentralized data infrastructure empowers users to upload images, compress them to save storage space, and use AI-driven classification features that ensure seamless accessibility and organization of photo libraries while having full control over data privacy.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Cloud Storage**:
    - Users will be able to upload images to CereSnap by leveraging the security of Cere Network's decentralized data clusters.
    - All images will be encrypted and anonymized. Private information of users shall be kept private, and all ownership of data remains retained.

- **Image Compression Options**:
    - The DApp will auto-compress all images before uploading to utilize a minimum amount of space.
    - Users can upload compressed images or stick with the original quality, depending on their needs.

- **AI-Driven Image Classification**:
    - Deploy various machine learning models to classify uploaded images into categories such as people, locations, events, or user-defined tags.
    - These categories will allow users to view specific pictures quickly.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
    - An easy-to-use interface enables smooth uploading, viewing, and sharing of images.
    - Users can filter classified views and search for images effortlessly.

- **Control Access and Sharing**:
    - Users maintain full control over their data with the option to share selected images or albums securely with others while keeping the rest private.

## Technical Implementation

- **Storage**: Utilize decentralized data clusters from Cere for secure image storage.
- **Compression Algorithm**: Apply efficient algorithms for compressing images to achieve optimal quality per file size.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Construct AI models that classify images using anonymized datasets to guarantee user privacy.
- **User Authentication**: Deliver secure authentication mechanisms to protect user accounts along with personal data.

## Benefits

- **Better Privacy**: Users will have full ownership of their data due to high security through encryption and anonymization.
- **Cost-Effective Storage**: Storage costs are reduced by compressing images while maintaining acceptable quality levels.
- **Effortless Management**: AI-powered classification reduces the management burden of large photo libraries, making it easier for users to find what they want.

## Target Audience

CereSnap is aimed at:

- Individuals seeking a secure platform for photo storage and management.
- Photographers who need to efficiently manage large volumes of photos.
- Enterprises requiring a secure facility to house customer images or project-related photos.

## Conclusion

CereSnap is set to transform the user's capability in image storage and management by fusing decentralized technology with advanced AI. By concentrating on user privacy, efficiency, and better management of digital assets, CereSnap will be well-positioned to meet the needs of users in today's digital ecosystem.
